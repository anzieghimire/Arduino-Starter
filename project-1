## 🧪 Circuits & Ohm’s Law (Explained for 5th Graders!)

Today I learned about **series circuits**, **parallel circuits**, and something super cool called **Ohm’s Law**! Here's what they mean — with examples that even a kid (like me!) can understand. 😄

### 🔗 Series Circuits

A **series circuit** is like a line of kids holding hands. If one kid lets go, the chain breaks!

# - All parts are connected one after another (like a line 🧍‍🧍‍🧍)
# - Electricity flows through *each* part, one at a time
# - If one light goes out 💡💤 — all of them stop working!

**Example:**  
Imagine 3 light bulbs on one path. If one bulb breaks, the electricity can’t go past it!

🪢 Parallel Circuits

A parallel circuit is like each kid holding their own balloon string — if one string breaks, the others still hold theirs.

    Each part has its own path

    Electricity can take different “roads” to each part

    If one light goes out, the others stay on! 💡💡💤

Example:
Each light has its own loop from the power.

⚡ Ohm’s Law (The Magic Math of Circuits)

Ohm’s Law is like a recipe that helps you figure out how electricity moves in a circuit.

It says:

V = I × R

Where:

    V is Voltage (like how strong the battery is)

    I is Current (how fast electricity flows)

    R is Resistance (how much it slows down)

💡 Fun Example:
If you have a 9V battery and a 3Ω resistor:

I = V ÷ R = 9 ÷ 3 = 3 Amps

That means 3 Amps of current flow through your circuit!
🧠 Quick Summary
Concept	What It Means	Fun Tip 🧠
Series Circuit	One path for electricity only	If one part breaks, all stop! 💥
Parallel Circuit	Many paths for electricity	Other parts keep going! ⚡
Ohm’s Law	Equation to measure electricity flow	V = I × R, super useful! 📏
