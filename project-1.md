# 🧠 Learning Circuits and Ohm’s Law (For 5th Graders!)

Hi! I’m a 10-year-old who’s learning Arduino and electronics. Today, I learned about:

- 🔗 Series Circuits  
- 🪢 Parallel Circuits  
- ⚡ Ohm’s Law  

Here’s what they mean in simple words — and how they work!

## 🔗 What is a Series Circuit?

A **series circuit** is when all the parts (like lights or buzzers) are connected one after another in a single line.

### 🚶 Example:
Imagine a line of kids passing a ball down the line. If one kid leaves, the ball can't move anymore!

### ⚡ In a circuit:
- The electricity flows in ONE path only
- If one part breaks, everything stops working ❌
- The lights share the power
