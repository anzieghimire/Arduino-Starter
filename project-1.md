# 🧠 Learning Circuits and Ohm’s Law (For 5th Graders!)

Hi! I’m a 10-year-old who’s learning Arduino and electronics. Today, I learned about:

- 🔗 Series Circuits  
- 🪢 Parallel Circuits  
- ⚡ Ohm’s Law  

Here’s what they mean in simple words — and how they work!
# Ohm’s Law Explained ⚡

Ohm’s Law is a basic rule that helps us understand how electricity flows in a circuit.
V = IR

Where:

- **V** = Voltage (measured in volts, V)  
  *Voltage is like the “push” that makes electricity move.*

- **I** = Current (measured in amps, A)  
  *Current is how much electricity is flowing.*

- **R** = Resistance (measured in ohms, Ω)  
  *Resistance is anything that slows down the electricity.*

## How It Works

- If the voltage (V) gets bigger, more current (I) flows.
- If the resistance (R) gets bigger, less current (I) flows.

---

## Example

Imagine you have:

- A battery with **9 volts** (V)
- A resistor with **3 ohms** (Ω)

Using Ohm’s Law, you can find the current:

## 🔗 What is a Series Circuit?

A **series circuit** is when all the parts (like lights or buzzers) are connected one after another in a single line.

### 🚶 Example:
Imagine a line of kids passing a ball down the line. If one kid leaves, the ball can't move anymore!

### ⚡ In a circuit:
- The electricity flows in ONE path only
- If one part breaks, everything stops working ❌
- The lights share the power
